.SH NAME
.B hsh - shell (command interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [command] [command options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a basic command interpreter, that trys to recreate the functionallity of sh or bash, this interpreter executes the commands passed from a command line, std input or some files
.SH SEARCH AND EXECUTION
In the interactive mode, we can execute different types of commands like: builtin commands, shell functions or programs
The builtins execute without calling a new process
If the command name doesn't match a function or builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program in the file system
The non interactive mode can be used without entering the hsh program, by redirecting the output from another command
.SS Search
hsh searches for the argument 0 of the string passed. First it searches for match builtins, then for executables in the current directory, and last searches for the command in the PATH
.SS Arguments
hsh handles command arguments, using the strtok function
.SS Builtins
